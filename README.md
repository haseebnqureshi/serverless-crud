# serverless-crud
Serverless framework example for launching a basic CRUD service.

## Quick Start

1. Go to ```config.yml``` in the repo's root directory. Change whatever you need to change there. These settings are then used by each service below for full consistency.

2. For local development, run ```npm install``` in the repo's root directory. This will install any dev dependency (like ```serverless-offline```).

3. That's it! Now you can go to each service and code your heart out.

## Useful Commands
To make full application ```deploy``` and ```remove``` simple, I've boiled them down to these two ```npm scripts``` that you can easily run:

- Run ```npm run-script info``` to ```sls info``` every service contained, getting a rundown of your app as a whole
- Run ```npm run-script deploy``` to ```sls deploy``` every service contained
- Run ```npm run-script remove``` to ```sls remove``` every service contained
